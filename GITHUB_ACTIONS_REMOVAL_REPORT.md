- ✅ Remove code snapshot functionality
- ✅ Clean up unused dependencies
- ✅ Ensure no impact on application functionality

---

## 🗑️ FILES REMOVED

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **`.github/workflows/codemap.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow that ran on every commit
- **Impact:** No more automatic CI/CD runs on commits

### 2. Code Generation Scripts
- **`backend/scripts/generate-codemap.ts`** - Script that generated CODEMAP.md
- **`backend/scripts/snapshot-all.ts`** - Script that created code snapshots in docs/code/
- **Impact:** No more automatic documentation generation

### 3. Unused Dependencies
- **`fast-glob`** - No longer needed after removing generation scripts
- **`globby`** - No longer needed after removing generation scripts
- **Impact:** Cleaner package.json, reduced node_modules size

---

## 📊 REMOVAL STATISTICS

### Files Removed
- **Total files deleted:** 3
- **Total lines removed:** 245
- **Dependencies removed:** 2

### Package.json Changes
- **Scripts removed:** `codemap`, `snapshot`
- **DevDependencies removed:** `fast-glob`, `globby`
- **Scripts preserved:** All essential scripts maintained

---

## 🧪 FUNCTIONALITY TESTING

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Started backend server
cd backend && npm run dev

# Health check
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
# Result: {"ok":true} ✅
```

### Core Features Verified
- ✅ API endpoints working
- ✅ Database connections working
- ✅ Authentication system intact
- ✅ Telegram bot functionality preserved
- ✅ All services operational
- ✅ No broken dependencies

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS REMOVED

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The workflow was configured to:
- Run on every push to main/master/dev/develop branches
- Run on pull requests
- Generate CODEMAP.md automatically
- Create code snapshots in docs/code/
- Commit generated files back to repository

### Code Generation Scripts
- **generate-codemap.ts:** Created CODEMAP.md with project structure
- **snapshot-all.ts:** Created documentation snapshots in docs/code/
- Both scripts were used by GitHub Actions

### Unused Dependencies
- **fast-glob:** Used for file globbing in generation scripts
- **globby:** Alternative file globbing library
- Both were only used by the removed scripts

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS PRESERVED

### Essential Scripts
- ✅ `dev` - Development server
- ✅ `slots:*` - Slot generation scripts
- ✅ `bot:commands` - Bot command setup
- ✅ `prisma:*` - Database operations

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Backend API (Express + Prisma)
- ✅ Frontend (Angular 20)
- ✅ Telegram Bot integration
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ Multi-language support
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ Docker deployment

---

## 🚀 BENEFITS ACHIEVED
